            <b>A</b> Wolf had been feasting too greedily, and a bone had stuck
            crosswise in his throat. He could get it neither up nor down, and of
            course he could not eat a thing. Naturally that was an awful state
            of affairs for a greedy Wolf. So away he hurried to the Crane. He
            was sure that she, with her long neck and bill, would easily be able
            to reach the bone and pull it out. "I will reward you very
            handsomely," said the Wolf, "if you pull that bone out for me." The
            Crane, as you can imagine, was very uneasy about putting her head in
            a Wolf's throat. But she was grasping in nature, so she did what the
            Wolf asked her to do. When the Wolf felt that the bone was gone, he
            started to walk away. "But what about my reward!" called the Crane
            anxiously. "What!" snarled the Wolf, whirling around. "Haven't you
            got it? Isn't it enough that I let you take your head out of my
            mouth without snapping it off?"

          <p>
            <b>T</b>wo Goats, frisking gayly on the rocky steeps of a mountain
            valley, chanced to meet, one on each side of a deep chasm through
            which poured a mighty mountain torrent. The trunk of a fallen tree
            formed the only means of crossing the chasm, and on this not even
            two squirrels could have passed each other in safety. The narrow
            path would have made the bravest tremble. Not so our Goats. Their
            pride would not permit either to stand aside for the other. One set
            her foot on the log. The other did likewise. In the middle they met
            horn to horn. Neither would give way, and so they both fell, to be
            swept away by the roaring torrent below.

            <b>The Crow and the Pitcher</b>
          </h1>
          <p>
            In a spell of dry weather, when the Birds could find very little to
            drink, a thirsty Crow found a pitcher with a little water in it. But
            the pitcher was high and had a narrow neck, and no matter how he
            tried, the Crow could not reach the water. The poor thing felt as if
            he must die of thirst. Then an idea came to him. Picking up some
            small pebbles, he dropped them into the pitcher one by one. With
            each pebble the water rose a little higher until at last it was near
            enough so he could drink.
